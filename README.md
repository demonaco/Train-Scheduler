# Train-Scheduler
Utilizing user input to append and update train times with the help of moment.js

## technologies used: 
Visual Studio Code, Google Fonts, Google Firebase, jQuery, Moment.js, Bootstrap

## Summary: In this assignment we took our first stab at setting up a backend database to store our user input (which was fun!). We continued the process of learning how to take user input and "do something" with it - in this case, using Firebase's API to store our inputs. We also took our first look at Moment.js to log time and manipulate it.

## Steps:
1. I started by building out the layout and created a container to hold my inputs. I then switched over to Bootstrap and used their forms which was easier. I also applied a Jumbotron for the header.

2. I created my CSS file and styled my page elements accordingly.

3. During the week I rewatched class videos to refamiliarize myself with the lessons.

4. I did some research on YouTube to learn more about the Javascript portions of the assignment. Read up Moment.js documentation.

5. I used the code drills/assignments heavily in terms of understanding the solution and implementing it correctly whenever I got stuck.

6. I also got help with starting up my Firebase with my tutor Ryan. 

7. Used console.log for testing and was able to put the whole picture together.
